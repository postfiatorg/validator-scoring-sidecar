"""Deterministic diversity sub-score (diversity formula v1).

Computes the authoritative per-validator diversity sub-score from the two
concentration counts the collector already produces and the model already
receives: how many validators in the round share the validator's country
and how many share its provider family. The model's own diversity value
stays in the published output as advisory; this module owns the number the
score formula consumes. Integer arithmetic only, so any independent
reimplementation is bit-identical. Specification, rationale, and empirical
validation live in the foundation repository's ``docs/DeterministicDiversity.md``.

The counts come from the frozen ``inputs/diversity_inputs.json`` so the
service and every sidecar compute from the same bytes.

Vendored from foundation ``scoring_service/services/diversity_formula.py``.
Local adaptations: ``ScoringResult`` is imported from the vendored parser
module instead of the foundation package, and the foundation-only
``diversity_formula_parameters`` manifest helper is omitted (the sidecar
reads the manifest, it does not build one). See the package docstring in
``__init__.py`` for the refresh procedure.
